1		install MC
1.1		open and close launcher (not game)

2		install the correct forge, the windows installer is included in this download
2.1 	don't change anything in the setup (NO need to boot game)

3		install liteloader (the windows installer is included in this download)
3.1		run the liteloader installer and select the forge version in the "extend from" box
3.2		finish the installer

4		setup game profile
4.1		edit the profile made by liteloader
4.2		set the name to cookiesrulezzz
4.3		set the desired amount of RAM (minimal 4GB)
4.4		set the gamefolder if you use multiprofile launcher
4.5		save and start the profile (this is just to make sure you see forge AND LiteLoader in the main menu)

5		convert to our pack
5.1		place THE CONTENT of the DOTminecraft file in your gamefolder (.minecraft for singleprofile launcher, multiprofile launchers: your chosen gamefolder)
5.2		make a shortcut of the clientboot.vbs file on your desktop (mac users... there's a command file too, try it or meh)
5.3		run the shortcut and wait untill the game pack is synced
5.4		once the minecraft launcher pops up the syncing is done and you can play (using the correct profile, this is a good moment to double check your profile has correct settings. 1GB won't do..)
5.5		the server should also be in the server list already, if you're whitelisted you can join :D
